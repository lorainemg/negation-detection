# Negation Detection

This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for the automatic detection of negation and the words they affect in Spanish text. The solution is divided into two phases: first, it identifies the negation signals, and second, it determines the scope of these signals. This approach can improve tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as Information Extraction, Sentiment Analysis, and Question Answering.

## Features

- Detects negation signals in Spanish texts
- Identifies the scope of negations
- Built using supervised machine learning techniques

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorainemg/negation-detection.git
cd negation-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After setting up, you can use the script for negation detection. Specific instructions on how to run the model can be added here.
